    "1.Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "1.Python was created by \"Guido van Rossum\", and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "2.Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. \n",
    " Object-oriented programming and structured programming .\n",
    "It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Is python Case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "3.Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "It is always good to use names that are more easily understood. \n",
    "If you want to store counts of 2 values, you would rather name your variables count1 and count2 instead of naming them C and c. \n",
    "Although the letter would give you separate variables, it can cause a lack of understanding in the longer run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Rules for Identifiers in Python\"\n",
    "To construct a Python identifier, a few requirements must be fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserved keywords (special words used for a specific purpose, e.g., while, for, if, etc.) cannot be used as identifier names.\n",
    "Python identifiers can contain lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numerals (0-9), and underscores ( _ ). This means that Identifiers in Python cannot contain special characters except underscore in them.\n",
    "The name of the identifier cannot begin with a number.\n",
    "The name of a Python identifier can begin with an underscore.\n",
    "The length of the identifier name is unrestricted.\n",
    "The names of Python identifiers are case sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What is correct extension for python file?\n",
    "4. Python is a widely used programming or coding language used for different purposes. \n",
    "The extensions for Python files are - \".py, .pyi, .pyc, .pyd, .pyo, .pyw, and .pyz\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Is python code is compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "5. \"Python is an interpreted language\", is the most common saying, which is also written in various books, but the hidden fact is Python is both compiled as well as an \n",
    "interpreted language. \n",
    "This means when we run a python code, it is first compiled and then interpreted line by line.\n",
    "The compilation part is mostly hidden from the user.\n",
    "While running the code, Python generates a byte code internally, this byte code is then converted using a python virtual machine (p.v.m) to generate the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Name a few block of code used to define in python language?\n",
    "6.Indentation is used to define a block of code in python.\n",
    "Braces {} are used to define a block of code in most programming languages, like C, C++, and Java. \n",
    "But this indentation makes python unique among all programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Alex'\n",
    "    \n",
    "if name == 'Alex':\n",
    "    print('Correct Name!!')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "\tprint('InCorrect Name:(')\n",
    "print('HI')\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Name!!\n",
    "HI\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are two separate code blocks in print('Correct Name!!') and print('InCorrect Name:(').\n",
    "In our example if-statement, the two code blocks are both four spaces indented.\n",
    "Now we can see that print(\"HI\") is not intended, hence print(\"HI\") will not be the part of else block.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character that given single-line comment in python?\n",
    "7.comments are lines of code or statement that the interpreter or compiler ignores during execution.\n",
    "\"#\"is used to \n",
    "ForExample:\n",
    "#This is a single line comment in python\n",
    "print(\"Hello world\")\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "    This is a single line comment in python\n",
    "    Hello world\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.Mention Function which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on ?\n",
    "8. The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "It also contains information on the build number and compiler used. For example, 3.5.2, 2.7.3 etc.\n",
    "this function also returns the current date, time, bits etc along with the version.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Python supports the creation of anonymous function at runtime, using construct called  \"lambda\".\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What does pip stand for in python?\n",
    "10. pip stands for \"preferred installer program\".\n",
    "Pip is one of the most famous and widely used package management system to install and manage software packages written in Python and found in Python Package Index (PyPI). \n",
    "Pip is a recursive acronym that can stand for either \"Pip Installs Packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python\".\n",

    "\n",
    "12.What are the benefits using python?\n",
    "12.\n",
    "1.\" Large developer community\"\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. \n",
    "In Stack Overflow’s 2021 Developer Survey, 48% of respondents said they work with Python.\n",
    "When other respondents were asked which technology they had a desire to learn, Python ranked first as the most wanted technology among developers.\n",
    "Python’s large open-source community means Pythonistas can enjoy strong peer support and helpful documentation. If you ever run into a roadblock, you can always check out Python forums or meetups to get help from other Python developers. \n",
    "This community support can be especially helpful if Python is your first programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\"Extensive libraries\"\n",
    "Python offers a wide range of libraries that can be used across various applications.\n",
    "Libraries are collections of resources that help us streamline application development. \n",
    "Instead of writing every piece of code from scratch, we can use libraries, which contain many pre-written functions and classes.\n",
    "Some popular Python libraries include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Numpy and SciPy\": For scientific computing, with a wide range of functions, algorithms, and optimizations, including linear algebra and statistics\n",
    "\"Keras, Seaborn, TensorFlow, and SciKit-Learn\": For machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and neural networks\n",
    "\"Scrapy\": For data science, allows you to make an effective web crawler and data scraper\n",
    "\"Pandas\": For data analysis, including data cleaning and manipulating both relational and labeled data\n",
    "\"Matplotlib and Plotly\": For data visualization and plotting graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Write less, do more\"\n",
    "Python has very concise syntax.\n",
    "This is noticeably true even when compared to other high-level programming languages, such as Java.\n",
    "By comparing the “Hello World” program in Python to Java, we can see that Python’s syntax is much more concise.\n",
    "Python’s simple syntax, combined with its large set of libraries, help us do more with less lines of code. \n",
    "This saves a lot of development time, and is one of the reasons for Python’s popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\" Portability\"\n",
    "Portability is another one of Python’s strengths. Portability refers to an application’s ability to run across various operating systems (OS). Unless your program contains system-specific calls, you can run your Python program across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux without modifying the program code. All you have to do is to use the Python interpreter that’s appropriate for your chosen platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s portability is largely attributed to its use of an interpreter instead of a compiler. \n",
    "Both interpreters and compilers convert source code into machine code. However, they do so at different times, and in different ways. Interpreters convert source code during program runtime, while compilers convert it before program runtime. Specifically, Python’s source code is converted into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can be executed on any platform that has a Python interpreter. In contrast, a compiler would convert source code into non-portable machine code which could only be executed on a specific platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages that use an interpreter are known as interpreted languages. Interpreted languages are generally more portable than compiled languages, which use a compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\"Wide range of use cases\"\n",
    "The Python programming language has various use cases in many growing fields, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science\n",
    "Machine learning\n",
    "Statistics\n",
    "Cybersecurity\n",
    "Game development\n",
    "Back-end web application development\n",
    "Embedded applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory Managed in Python?\n",
    "14. In Python, memory is managed by the Python manager which determines where to put the application data in the memory.\n",
    "So, we must have the knowledge of Python memory manager to write efficient code and maintainable code.\n",
    "*Python memory is managed by Python private heap space.\n",
    "*All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap.\n",
    "*The programmer does not have access to this private heap and interpreter takes care of this Python private heap.\n",
    "*The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by the Python memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.\n",
    "*Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycle all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.\n",
    " \n",
    "15. \n",
    "15.Step 1 — \"Downloading the Python Installer\"\n",
    "*Go to the official Python download page for Windows.\n",
    "*Find a stable Python 3 release.This tutorial was tested with Python version 3.10.10.\n",
    "*Click the appropriate link for your system to download the executable file: Windows installer (64-bit) or Windows installer (32-bit).\n",
    "Step 2 — \"Running the Executable Installer\"\n",

    "*After the installation is complete, a Setup was successful message displays.\n",
    "Step 3 — Adding Python to the Environment Variables (optional)\n",
    "Skip this step if you selected Add Python to environment variables during installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access Python through the command line but you didn’t add Python to your environment variables during installation, then you can still do it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, locate the Python installation directory on your system. The following directories are examples of the default directory paths:\n",

    "16.Is indentation required in Python ?\n",
    "16.Indentation is mandatory in python to define the blocks of statements. It is preferred to use whitespaces instead of tabs to indent in python. \n",
    "Python uses four spaces as default indentation spaces.\n",
    "Indentation in Python is simply the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "Indentation in other languages like C, C++, etc., is just for readability, but in Python, the indentation is an essential and mandatory concept that should be followed when writing a python code; otherwise, the python interpreter throws IndentationError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is the leading whitespace (spaces or/and tabs) before any statement in Python. \n",
    "The reason why indentation is important in python is that the indentation serves another purpose other than code readability. Python treats the statements with the same indentation level (statements with an equal number of whitespaces before them) as a single code block. So whereas in languages like C, C++, etc. a block of code is represented by curly braces { }, in python a block is a group of statements that have the same Indentation level i.e same number of leading whitespaces.\n",
